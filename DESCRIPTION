Description: The goldeneye package is designed to allow data to safely be shared
  between R users over insecure channels.  While it does require using R, the 
  interfaces are written to be as simple as possible in order to reduce the 
  technical barrier for beginner R users.  A shiny interface is also provided to
  further simplify usage.  This package was developed as part of the
  NordForsk-funded DigiVet project.
